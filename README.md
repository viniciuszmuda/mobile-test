Let's move on with some small rules...

## Business rules

* If you find any bugs on the app, add a note on your PR with how to reproduce, and prioritize the severity as you think.
* Feel free to run this on any kind of simulator or device, just let us know how you have run.

### Hints

* Everything we run we use a jenkinsFile on Jenkins.

## Non functional requirements
